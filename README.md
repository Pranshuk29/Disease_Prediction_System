Here I have created two projects that carry out disease prediction in two different ways.
Project3_1. It asks the users about their health related data and reports a disease accordingly, based on the most accurate model out of several models used.
Project3_2. It asks users about the symptomps they are facing and reports the probable disease accordingly based on trained ML models.
